## Quick start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Move to the appropriate directory:<br />
3. Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
   *At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:4000`.*
